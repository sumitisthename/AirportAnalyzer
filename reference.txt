Checkin, security and immigration at DXB airport swift, lounge with good a la carte options and friendly service. Boarding well organized. Delayed by 45 minutes due to bad weather. Flight uneventful. Despite delayed arrival, remote stand with bus transfer. It took me 50 minutes from arrival at remote stand till arrival at the terminal. My plan to have a nice breakfast at the lounge was shattered. I had just a 10 minutes at the Platinum/Gold lounge, but left because there was no seat available, no clean cup to make a coffee, and long toilet queues. My flight to Bangkok was a remote stand bus gate. Boarding was poorly organized, as Business class and status guests were asked to wait till Economy has done boarding; the gate agent changed his mind and let C Class and status guests on the bus after 2 bus loads of Y class passengers had gone. It was rather chaotic. The flight on a leased CX aircraft was on time and uneventful. The IFE screens in the bulkhead rows of my section were broken, but large IPads were offered as a replacement, which was great. My food was mediocre. The flights were ok, but the chaotic transfer at Hamad airport left a bitter aftertaste.
