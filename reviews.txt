"chaotic transfer at Hamad airport"

Michael Schade (Thailand) 12th March 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   Checkin, security and immigration at DXB airport swift, lounge with good a la carte options and friendly service. Boarding well organized. Delayed by 45 minutes due to bad weather. Flight uneventful. Despite delayed arrival, remote stand with bus transfer. It took me 50 minutes from arrival at remote stand till arrival at the terminal.  My plan to have a nice breakfast at the lounge was shattered. I had just a 10 minutes at the Platinum/Gold lounge, but left because there was no seat available, no clean cup to make a coffee, and long toilet queues. My flight to Bangkok was a remote stand bus gate. Boarding was poorly organized, as Business class and status guests were asked to wait till Economy has done boarding; the gate agent changed his mind and let C Class and status guests on the bus after 2 bus loads of Y class passengers had gone. It was rather chaotic. The flight on a leased CX aircraft was on time and uneventful. The IFE screens in the bulkhead rows of my section were broken, but large IPads were offered as a replacement, which was great. My food was mediocre. The flights were ok, but the chaotic transfer at Hamad airport left a bitter aftertaste.

Michael Schade (Thailand) 8th March 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   First leg was in Economy, 2nd in First. Check in at BKK airport fast and friendly. Contract lounge at the new Satellite terminal large, but limited western breakfast options. Boarding started 30 minutes late and another 15 minutes wait at the air bridge. Service was good with slightly improved F&B offerings. I was lucky to be on an aircraft with their upgraded WIFI services which worked real well. 3-4-3  configuration with rather hard seats. Transfer in Doha was good with a stay at the Al Safwa F lounge. Food was good. My final leg to Dubai was changed from a Qsuite to a 2-2-2 configuration. After many back and forth, they were willing to change to another Qsuite flight 30 minutes later. The flight was pleasant and uneventful.

Review 3:
"Qatar Airways changed the aircraft"


J Dayle (United States) 24th February 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   Qatar Airways changed the aircraft and did not notify us. We entered the Boeing 777 cabin to find that we had Paid for a Mercedes and would be flying in a Mini-Cooper. I didn't know airplanes with this drastically old configuration were still even in service. TIt was a miserable experience and we are changing our refundable return tickets to another airline. I won't be spending any money on Qatar Airways in the future!

"attendants were very helpful" 


S Melkov (United Kingdom) 24th February 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   On my way to Doha, it was amazing, flight attendants were very helpful and attentive. Doha to Colombo was delayed and after take off asked for a drink which I was told would be served in about 10 minutes, it took more than an hour for cabin crew to star serving drinks and food. After the service they never came back to ask if anything else was needed.

✅ Trip Verified |   Both flights were excellent. Kind and professional staff on both flights, good food options (like that I can chose when to eat), comfortable flights. Due to distances at Doha airport, I appreciated that one of the small cart drivers offered his services to take me as close as possible to the train, connecting me to the center of the main terminal.

Review 6:
"discourtesy with the security staff"


K Brawn (United Kingdom) 18th February 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   I have been a frequent traveller throughout my nearly 60 years as an air passenger. In all that time, I have never encountered such an unprecedented level of discourtesy as I did with the security staff at the Qatar Airways gate. at Doha. My husband and I had already smoothly passed through two transit security checks with Qatar Airways on our return journey from New Zealand. As we tried to board Business Class, I was surprised to be pulled over again for another bag check. The treatment I received was rude and demeaning. Everything in my rucksack was unpacked, which was then swabbed inside and out. I was manually body searched in front of everybody and my clothes, shoes and even hair was swabbed. This took place for a prolonged period of time in front of every other passenger that filed past - the flight had been called. When I subsequently touched one of the items in the second tray of my belongings (to open the zip to demonstrate there were only documents inside) the lady raised her voice, ordering me to stand back and not to handle any of my possessions. I tried to explain I was only trying to help but was met with more incivility. I would add that my husband, who was stood with me, had to witness this affront without any recourse to offer his assistance. When I was finally allowed to leave - the lady having found nothing of any suspicion - I felt utterly humiliated. This awful experience with Qatar Airways was only saved by the helpful and impeccable service of a wonderfully professional air steward on board called Eugenia - thank you kind lady. Her humanity and warmth restored my equilibrium. However the overall experience of our return journey was that, with the exception of Eugenia, the customer service is appalling. . I understand security is important but there was no need for my encounter to be as intimidating, embarrassing and uncivil as it was.

"Good but food needs improvement"


Ishan Jani (United States) 13th February 2025

Not Verified | The food was really good, but the items listed on the menu, such as coconut cheesecake and stir-fried noodles, were unavailable. The seats were small but had amazing sleep amenities. The amenities kit was excellent. I requested an Asian vegetarian meal, which was very good, but it would have been better if there was naan or roti. The food quantity needs improvement. The legroom was good but could be better. This was my first time flying with Qatar Airways, and I would fly with them again.

"the flight was amazing"


Ishan Jani (United Kingdom) 13th February 2025

Not Verified | So this was my first time on a 787-8. The seats are different on this plane compared to the Airbus A350. The 787-8 was really good, but I didn’t like the way the headrests were. The legroom was kinda tight with not much space, and I didn’t get a window seat—I got a middle row seat instead. But the flight was amazing. That mango juice is too good, omg! The food was great as well. There was palak paneer, but there was no paneer, only corn.

✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Copenhagen in Business Class on an A350-900. This aircraft featured the renowned Qsuite configuration - an epitome of comfort and privacy. Qatar Airways’ onboard service was nothing short of world-class, delivering excellence at every touchpoint. Both the hard and soft product were executed to perfection, setting a standard that is unmatched in commercial aviation.

✅ Trip Verified | Goa (GOX) to Doha in Business Class on a 787-8 The seating on this aircraft was of the older configuration, yet exceptionally comfortable. Service, as expected, was impeccable - flawless execution in line with Qatar Airways’ consistently high standards. Upon arrival in Doha, disembarkation was via stairs rather than an aerobridge. This is where Qatar Airways truly excels: the moment the first batch of Business Class passengers boarded the transfer bus, there was no unnecessary delay. Rather than waiting for it to fill up, the bus departed within minutes - a hallmark of true premium service.

Walter Gujer (Thailand) 8th February 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   Very excited to fly again on an A380, my favorite aircraft. Check-in was nice and friendly, loved the lounge and staff there too! While the male crew were nice and looked happy, the female staff were mostly sour. Did not appreciate when the crew put my meal on my tray while I was at the bar. When I returned, the food was stone cold. I discussed that with the excellent purser. After that, the staff were sickly sweet. I decided to spend most of the time at the bar. Shame, but the next flight on Qatar was again excellent.

Review 12:
“customer services unhelpful”


Tilly Hoskins (United Kingdom) 8th February 2025

✅ Trip Verified | All that Glitters is not Gold On board their aircraft, Qatar Airways aim to present a spotless and glamorous experience. But sadly the mask is slipping badly. The 3-4-3 configuration on their 777 fleet has rightly been described as a crime against humanity. My real complaint with the company comes however behind the scenes. If you EVER have to deal with customer services they are obstructive and unhelpful. I paid over £1000 for an Economy Convenience multi-city ticket with some inbuilt ticket flexibility. I wanted, and indeed needed for medical reasons, a 2 hour stop in Doha. I have to administer medication which it is not possible to do on board. It could, indeed, endanger other pax to do it on the aircraft rather than in the airport. So I was pretty miffed when Qatar changed their schedules and cut my connection time down to 1h20 and then refused to listen to me about it. They COULD have agreed to put me on the flight taking off 5 minutes before my original booking to keep my 2 hour layover intact, which was the same price, but they have refused to do this. This isn’t the first time I have bumped up against their intransigence and arrogance and, to be frank, I don’t think I shall ever fly with Qatar again. I would strongly warn you to be very very careful about using them.

“exceptional service and attention”


Samantha Svhucroft (Australia) 7th February 2025

Not Verified | I recently had the opportunity to fly to Prague with Qatar Airways, and I would like to commend the exceptional service and attention I received throughout my journey. I would like to specifically acknowledge Uttam and Wan, who went above and beyond to assist me in retrieving my phone that had fallen between my seat after the flight had already landed. I had to wait for an engineer to come on board, but they were on the floor with various tools trying to reach my phone. I am extremely grateful for their efforts. This is a prime example of going the extra mile, and I hope they receive the recognition they deserve. Please continue to uphold your excellent service standards.

“cabin crew worked tirelessly”


Tai Wei Wong (Malaysia) 4th February 2025

✅ Trip Verified | Had a pleasant experience with Qatar Airways. The sector from KUL to DOH was not perfect. The plane used was old and with a 2-2-2 business class configuration. Less privacy and lack of storage space. The crew made up to the deficit. Lobster meal was very good. The next sector from DOH to IAH was perfect. Business class passengers were given much priority. The in-flight supervisor came to introduce herself to each and every business class passenger. The cabin crew worked tirelessly to serve every request. Wonderful. Qsuites business class is simply amazing. I managed to catch 8 hours of sleep all together. The quality of the food served was top-notched. I tried purchasing the WiFi service but not successful though. Overall, very good quality of production and service. Only grudge is probably the price. It was much higher than any other airlines.

Dr. Akeil Al-Faraj (Canada) 28th January 2025

✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew with Qatar Airways from Doha to Amman on QR404, dated January 26th, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience! The check-in process was seamless, and the staff were friendly and efficient. The aircraft was modern and clean, with comfortable seating and ample legroom. The inflight entertainment system was impressive, offering a vast selection of movies, TV shows, and music. The food was delicious, with a variety of options to suit different tastes. What truly impressed me, however, was the exceptional service provided by the cabin crew. They were attentive, courteous, and went above and beyond to ensure that all passengers had a comfortable and enjoyable flight. Overall, I would highly recommend Qatar Airways to anyone looking for a top-notch flying experience. Keep up the fantastic work!

Shayne Haridas (Saudi Arabia) 27th January 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   My recent flight from Calicut to Hamad Airport on January 25th, 2025, was generally uneventful, but had several areas where I believe Qatar Airways could improve the passenger experience. Firstly, the check-in process at Calicut Airport was extremely slow, despite having completed online check-in beforehand. The cabin temperature remained uncomfortably warm throughout most of the flight. The quality of the in-flight meals, while tasty, was somewhat diminished by smaller portions. My breakfast croissant was completely flattened. The seats felt less spacious and harder than I'm accustomed to. Finally, I was disappointed by the limited selection of movies available on Oryx One.

Despite the absence of Qsuite, the experience was supremely comfortable, as is expected. The onboard service was warm and attentive, complemented by their signature on-demand meal offerings. The seamless blend of comfort, service, and sophistication once again highlights why Qatar Airways’ Business Class consistently ranks at or near the top.

Despite the absence of the Qsuite, the seats are exceptionally comfortable, ensuring a luxurious experience. The inflight service was flawless, showcasing their hallmark on-demand meal service. I was particularly impressed by the noticeable upgrade in meal quality. The vegetarian option was thoughtfully prepared, with a refreshing lightness compared to the heavier, oilier meals of previous years. Overall, this was an outstandingly comfortable flight that lives up to Qatar Airways’ reputation for delivering the finest Business Class experience in the skies.

✅ Trip Verified |   As always superb experience! Perfect service, friendly and attentive cabin crew, clean and fresh cabin. Food excellent! And took me back to Air France in the 90s on long-haul flights, a lounge in the business class cabin. Excellent for stretching your legs, get a drink and mingle with other passengers. Splendid idea! But not free basic WiFi.

Review 34:
"downgraded my plane"


Kevin Kozinchik (Spain) 14th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   I have flown them 6 times in the last year from Madrid to South Africa via Doha and in business class. Those who have flown on their Q-Suites (777), 787s, A350s, and their older 777 where it was 2 seats on the window with no real divider or privacy, understand there is a huge difference in quality between their planes and the experience overall. When choosing my route for an upcoming trip with them I chose a route that had a Q-suite followed by a 787, as they offer the most privacy and comfort. I just received notice that they have downgraded my plane from Doha to Johannesburg to their oldest configuration of their 777 where there are 2 seats on the window, no real divider, and no privacy at all. I understand that sometimes changes are necessary, however I've spent 3 days now trying to get them to change the 1 leg of my journey, the leg where they downgraded the plane to the old 777, to an alternative flight that would simply put me back on the 787. I'm not looking for an upgrade to a Q-suite, I just don't want to be on the same plane I booked and paid for. However, their service team refuses to make the change without me paying a fare difference. Apparently the only time they will allow a free change is if they downgrade you from the Q-suite, which is ridiculous. If they moved it from a 787 to an A350 it would have been fine, however their old 777 configuration is by no means anywhere near the same quality of experience. There is no flex, no desire to keep your business. I realize I am complaining about a business class experience, which may seem petty to some, however when you fly a lot, spend a lot of money to do so, there should be an expectation of service from the partners you choose.

Review 35:
"serious confusion" 


D Mayle (Malaysia) 13th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   There was serious confusion conveyed by flight attendants to passengers after arriving in Phuket. “Passengers flying on to Penang should disembark at Phuket.” “Passengers going on to Penang should stay seated.” “Passengers who will go on to Penang should come forward now to disembark.” “You should not be trying to disembark yet.” Now you need to disembark at the rear of the plane.” “You should not be coming back here. Return to the front.” Then a scheduled 90 minute layover became 3 hours. Upon arrival in Penang Qatar did not get a jetway, and it was raining hard. After moving forward to disembark we were told by the pilot that the airport is requiring us to sit on the aircraft for 30 minutes until the rain stops. About 40 minutes later the pilot informed us that we will have to wait at least another 10 minutes.

Review 36:
"too bland or salty"


Harish Vasudevan (United States) 7th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   The food and choices on the long haul from Bos-Doh was quite stressful. The Economy regular meals were to die for to be honest- some of the best chicken biryani, which you wouldn’t see in the special meal menus. This time it was stuff that neither me nor my family could get half way through. Either too bland or salty. Also the service was slow - kids get super cranky on late night flights without food and no butter, salt, pepper and sugar.  Unlike many other airlines, QR’s economy class is really good. In fact that was my biggest selling point for wanting to fly QR this time- collecting air miles is not an easy job! An older aircraft having >90% occupancy with an out of order toilet plus wi-fi doesn’t help. On the positive side, massive shout out to QR ground staff from Bos for a smooth path from check in to boarding. Also to the Doh- MAA flight pursers for explaining the shortage of on board meal options- only chicken was available in the general category.

Review 37:
“no feedback in a month”


R Keale (Sweden) 2nd December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   It started when we checked in at Maldives and the check-in couldn't give us any boarding passes for the second flight between Doha and Copenhagen. They asked us to contact the Qatar Airways service desk after arriving in Doha. We did this upon arrival but was then referred to another Qatar Airways service desk. After queuing our way through the third service desk, we were told that they could not give us a boarding pass due to the flight being overbooked. They wanted us to go to some other service desk several times. After 3 hours of waiting we finally got boarding shortly after check-in at the gate opened. We had to rush to the gate. Since I had not received a boarding pass at the airport, I could not do any purchases from the airport shops as I normally do. While I wasn't checked in, all the updates via Qatar Airways' app on my mobile didn't show up, which features I appreciate. I have sent an email to their customer service support but no feedback in a month.

"comfortable 5 hours in the air"


Virginia Bolton (Australia) 30th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Qatar Airways is using Oman Air planes and crew on certain sectors. This sector was changed a few months after I booked my ticket, and I didn’t mind so much because I was keen to experience Oman Air. The business class layout is ok, and the seat was very comfortable. There were only 3 passengers travelling in business class on this flight and we were well attended to. The food and wine was good. Nothing more, nothing less. The crew were very pleasant and enjoyed a chat. I find the Qatar entertainment very limited and not a wide selection of movies. The flight itself was very smooth. Overall, a comfortable 5 hours in the air.

"Outstanding flight and crew"


Virginia Bolton (Australia) 30th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Outstanding flight and crew. The food and wine were superb. The FA looking after our section was outstanding in her quiet delivery of her service. I had a very different experience on each of the four sectors I flew, and this sector together with the Doha/Nairobi sector were on par. Attentive service, good food and a comfy seat. The entertainment choices are very limited so I usually end up listening to my own music. The seat was very comfortable and I managed to get 6 hours sleep.

Review 40:
"far from premium service"


G Aliyev (Russian Federation) 27th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew Qatar Airways in business class, expecting the renowned QSuite experience. However, the aircraft was changed, and the QSuite was not available. The issues didn’t end there. When I contacted customer service to inquire about rebooking, the agent I spoke with was unhelpful and uninterested in assisting. Unfortunately, the service on board was equally disappointing. During boarding, the cabin crew paid little attention to passengers, creating a lack of warmth and hospitality. The in-flight dining service was far below the standard I expected: The dine-on-demand service was not offered. When I requested mezze, I was told it was unavailable. My alternative request for miso resulted in receiving a completely different dish. For the main course, two out of four options on the menu were unavailable. I was served chicken that appeared to be from the economy menu, and it was tasteless. My second meal, sushi, was barely edible. Even basic items like orange juice for a mocktail were not available. For a 12-hour flight, the limited meal selection and poor quality were unacceptable. When I raised my concerns with the purser, I did not receive an apology but was told I should have pre-ordered my meal—despite not being informed of this requirement beforehand. This experience was far from the premium service Qatar Airways promises its business class passengers. I hope the airline addresses these shortcomings to ensure better service in the future.

Review 41:
“Love at First Flight”


C Richardson (United Kingdom) 26th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified | "Love at First Flight". I took Qatar Airways for the first time two years ago. As a frequent business traveler, customer experience, value for money and safety are the two most important factors. In my opinion, Qatar Airways achieved full marks in all the three areas. Qatar Airways is now my No. 1 choice. Some of the meals that you have provided onboard have been one of the best experience that I have had over thirty years of flying. I feel treated as a "First Class" passenger on Economy class.

Review 42:
"flight lived up to expectations"


G Leyne (United Kingdom) 26th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   The flight lived up to expectations, though this older aircraft did not have as wide a range of movies loaded into its IFE compared to the flights operated by newer A350 and 787. Boarding of the aircraft was efficient and respected the assigned seating Zones. Good service from cabin crew, who were very courteous. The first meal service was a bland chicken sandwich (because the flight operated late at night, when most people just wanted to sleep). A full cooked meal service was provided later in the flight for breakfast, however. The flight operated on time.

"always polite and attentive" 


N Aguilar (United Kingdom) 25th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified | Chaotic check-in at Kathmandu. The airport struggles to cope with volume of passengers, both land-side and air-side. The flight departed an hour late due to local air traffice restrictions, despite the incoming aircraft having arrived on time. The aircraft was one of the older ones in the fleet, and the IFE was not touch screen, nor did it have the same breadth of range of entertainment options as offered on Qatar's newer aircraft. However, service was good, including food & beverage offerings, despite the aircraft being fully occupied. Cabin crew worked hard and were always polite and attentive. As a result of the late departure, we arrived in Doha an hour late, too. The aircraft was parked a long bus ride away from the terminal, which didn't help the delay.

Review 44:
"Onboard service was excellent"


S Deylan (United Kingdom) 24th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   The best thing about this airline is the good training of its staff. They have been trained to be polite even in the face of problems. It goes a long way to making the experience more pleasant than it otherwise could have been. The booking experience  via their website was not fully satisfactory as the seat map could not be accessed at the time of booking nor via 'Manage your booking' after the booking was made. I had to ring up the call centre  to request them to book my specific seats. The call-centre staff were polite and very willing to help, but the quality of the phone line was poor. Online check-in could not be fully completed, requiring manual document checks at the airport (Heathrow) for the issue of the boarding pass. However, the queues for the self-service check-in machines at the airport was very long and every passenger seemed to require manual documentation check by staff (who were too few to cope with this - but handled it politely)s. Onboard service was excellent and plenty of food provided for the flight. IFE had an impressive selection of movies and TV shows.

"leave the queue to adjust the weight" 


V Hargan (Netherlands) 21st November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Traveling from Delhi to Düsseldorf, we encountered a long check-in queue, some open counters in the economy class were left unattended, with staff chatting instead of assisting passengers. We had an allowed baggage weight of 100 kg for our four tickets, each with a 25 kg limit. We checked in two bags, but the staff said that one bag weighed 27 kg instead of 25 kg and demanded payment for the extra 2 kg. We had to leave the queue to adjust the weight and upon returning, were asked to start from the end of the line. Onboard I had to settle for an Indian vegetarian meal, which I did not enjoy. While Doha airport was beautiful, we were transported to our connecting flight to Düsseldorf by bus, which was uncomfortable.

“only offer you what is left"


M Lopez (Spain) 16th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified | The plane was fine, for a long flight it is important, but the bathrooms were dirty. The meals they offer, you can choose if you are in the front, from the middle to the back, they only offer you what is left, pasta. The same at breakfast, if you don't want the option they give you, they tell you to wait until they serve the entire plane. You can ignore all this, but when you arrive at your destination and they have lost your luggage, the disappointment is total. And worse, when upon returning home, they lose your luggage again, they deliver it to you later, the suitcases are broken, they follow the instructions of their call center for the claim, and finally they do not take responsibility for the damages.

After we took off, the refreshing towel that was given before mwas still on my counter for about 30 minutes. I was served with breakfast 30 minutes after we took off. They left me for the next 8 hours on a 13 and 1/2 hours flight. I was taking naps off and on but lost track of time. No one checked if I needed anything. When I requested to have my meal served, it took about an hour and half from start to finish. The service was slow. No one was being served at that time around me. My dessert plate sat on my table for another 30 minutes after I finished. I asked for a drink about 2 hours to landing, no one picked up after for an hour or so.
