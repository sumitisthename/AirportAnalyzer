Review 1:
"we follow the rules"


Chiame Genila (Netherlands) 18th February 2024

Not Verified |  By far the worst experience ever. I have never seen and airport weighting bags and specially handbags by the gram. When i said this to the person who did my check in, his answer was: 'we follow the rules'.  If you want to follow rules, be regular, not only where you can exploit foreigners.

Review 2:
"the worst airport terminal"


Shiva Badruswamy (United States) 17th February 2024

Not Verified |  Chatrapati Shivaji Airport’s T2 terminal is absolutely the worst airport terminal I have ever visited and I have been to many global airports. The digital sign boards are broken with many having paper stuck on it for instructions. The transfer from international to domestic terminals is an excruciatingly painful process with no signs or helpful people telling you how to do this. The worst thing is you have to come out of the international terminal, and take a bus or taxi to the domestic terminal, which you would need to do under extreme eye watering pollution. No worthwhile airport in the world does this - terminal transfers are easy and comfortable. Other people’s comments on rude behavior of staff and immigration officers is spot on. There is no “how may I help you” counter. Never again will I fly to this airport.

Review 3:
"they did their best" 


P Hashil (India) 11th February 2024

✅ Trip Verified |  We travelled via Air India on and are a frequent flier via Mumbai usually with no issues. A recent return from Bangkok to Bangalore via Mumbai had a slight issue wherein there was a delaying the primary flight, and we had some unforeseen delay on top of that. We didn't find the right exit terminal quick enough. Inspite of a heated discussion that took place between my family and few of the official, they did their best in the given circumstances. They sent a staff to expedite our transfer they kept said staff updated via walkie about how and where to go. And the staff also ensured we reached with all of our belongings intact. Kudos to that.

Review 4:
"proud of the lost and found department"


B Idicheria (United States) 31st January 2024

Not Verified |  I lost my wallet with all my credit & debit cards, license, job ID plus cash at Mumbai international airport, I never thought to get it back. During our boarding to our connected flight to TRV, Air India staff provided lost and found number, we called 1st day, they told us to call back next day and next day we called they found the wallet with all our ID's plus cash. They wanted to get the wallet in person with copy of our passport and boarding pass. we authorized our cousin who live in Mumbai to collect the wallet. They sealed our wallet in a box very secure. We feel very proud of the lost and found department at the airport. Great service.

Review 5:
“airport was a sub par experience”


P Saeed (United Arab Emirates) 4th December 2023

✅ Trip Verified | The airport which is built to cater the Megacity of Mumbai does not live up to the expectations. The first thing I noticed upon arrival is the poor air-conditioning. The airport temperature is not comfortable especially after a 10-15 minute walk from the gate to the Immigration. I also noted that some travlators were out of order without any signage. The airport taxi situation, especially in the Uber pick up zone gets extremely chaotic. When departing from the airport the air-conditioning was poor throughout all the way till the gate. The temperature was uncomfortable. I even noticed a pigeon flying inside the departure check in area. The Immigration queue was poorly organised with people jumping the lanes without any one maintaining the order. I also noticed multiple ceiling panels were missing in the Immigration area which is something one would not miss while waiting in the long queue. Overall the airport was a sub par experience considering it is the gateway to Mumbai which is one of the largest cities in the world.

Review 6:
"I love the overall vibe"


2 reviews



S Shetty (India) 21st October 2023

Not Verified |  I love the overall vibe of Mumbai airport, the artworks keep changing and I am happy to spend time walking around gazing at the same. The Adani Lounge on the international side is quite good and has enough to keep you fed and rested before the flight. There are also a good variety of food and shopping options. I think the number of security counters needs to be increased for international travel, I was traveling at an off peak time so it was ok but during the rush hours it can take a bit. The arrival experience was also quite good and I was out of the airport within one hour of arriving at the international flight. I remain a bit mystified by the habit of scanning handbags of all passengers on arrival after immigration and baggage collection which I have rarely experienced at other airports in the world. The airport charges for parking and even for taking Uber have become really high though and need to be rationalised, since passengers already pay a significant user fee and the airport is not connected to a metro line or any public transport option so this is quite usurious as a practice since it is not like you can choose to avoid taking a taxi. The only way to avoid these charges is to use an auto rickshaw which is not possible with luggage.

Review 8:
"it does not get any better" 


2 reviews



Nash Degaonkar (United States) 15th September 2023

Not Verified |  Some improvements compared to my last visit but still, it does not get any better. Immigration crowd has no improvement yet, especially for Indian passport holders. E-visa queue however, was quicker. Baggage claim was a headache, and time consuming. Wifi, still pathetic, requires an Indian phone number and 45 minutes validity makes it absurd and sickening for foreign passengers, especially those in transit. Customs officers are nothing but thieves, and incompetent bureaucrats who are fleecing from everyone, even children. Taxi operators can charge absurd fares sometimes, so Uber should be trusted more than anyone else.

Review 9:
"Immigration was hugely crowded"


S Galkuni (United Arab Emirates) 10th September 2023

✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Mumbai to Dubai. Luggage check in took much longer time for all passengers. So at 10-45 pm we all were at immigration. Plane take off time was 11-30 pm Immigration was hugely crowded. No officer was there to take care of the mess. To take care of the passengers who may miss their flight because of delay in immigration. Only 4 windows were open for some 100 passengers. At the same time other4 windows are running in peaceful manner for 10 businesses class people or diplomats. Officers managing those windows show next level of rudeness if economy passengers request them for immigration check. Airport and all airlines need to realise that they run only because of economy passengers not because of 5% business class passengers.

Review 10:
"upgrade the quality and cleanliness"


S Russo (Italy) 5th September 2023

✅ Trip Verified | The airport is beautiful and the security is efficient but do expect to queue for as much as half an hour when there are many flights departing. In the early morning (before 7 am) many of the better food venues are shut so passengers craving for a coffee or a snack have no choice but purchase from the small stalls that sell substandard sandwiches, samosas and coffee, chai etc. at astronomic prices. I fully understand this is an International Airport and is located in a business hub of a mega polis but if you charge the equivalent of 4 to 4.50 Euros for a sandwich or 3 Euros for a coffee that would cost 20 - 30 inr at an Indian train station at least upgrade the quality and cleanliness.
